The DAI is locked in a so-called smart contract and can't be moved, thus creating a full reserve peg. The DAI-CuraDAI uses the same exchange rate as the Dollar-Guilder pair. The currency runs on top of the Ethereum blockchain, and as a result, can be transacted for various digital assets. This is a proof of concept version of the CuraDAI, please use with caution."
